#### *How to add an IP camera to a Raymarine Axiom plotter*

Raymarine offers a range of cameras for their Axiom Pro plotters, but they can cost upwards of **£500**.  
There are ways to connect third-party IP cameras, but existing guides are outdated, and some cameras are discontinued. This guide provides an updated method that worked for me and others that followed the guide.

## 📌 **Hardware Requirements**  

### **Plotter:**  
- **Raymarine Axiom Pro 9 and other similar models**  

### **Camera:**  
- *Recommended:* [Gadinan 8MP/5MP/4MP H.265 IP Camera](https://www.aliexpress.com) (Aliexpress)  
  - Supports 4K & H.265, but needs to run on **H.264 at 720p**  
  - Recommended lens: **2.8mm focus** was ideal for my engine room
  - Must support ONVIF with authentication disabled
  - Use the 12v version and not the POE version  

### **Power Over Ethernet (POE) Considerations:**  
- POE cameras require **48V**, which is not readily available on boats  
- Instead, a **12V camera** is used with a [**passive POE injector**](./POE_Injector_Pair.jpeg)

- **Power Source:** 12V near the helm  

### **Network Connection:**  
- Raymarine sells a **Raynet to RJ45 cable** (£50-£80)  
- Alternative: Cut a **Raynet to Raynet cable** (May be in the Axiom box) and crimp an **RJ45 connector**  This will give you 2 cables. Follow the wiring in the file This will give you 2 cables. Follow the wiring in the file [**RJ45**](./RJ45.png)

- This method supports **two cameras** without needing a network hub on Axiom Pro models with 2 spare Raynet inputs

## 🛠 **Camera Setup & Configuration**  

1. **Configure the Camera on a PC First**  
   - Default login credentials (check the box or manual):  
     ```
     Username: admin
     Password: 123456 / password / admin
     ```
   - **Disable On-Screen Date/Time** (as the camera lacks internet access)  
   - **Enable ONVIF**  
   - **Disable ONVIF Authentication** (necessary for Axiom compatibility)  

2. **Video Stream Settings**  
   - **Encoding:** H.264  
   - **Resolution:** 1280x720  
   - **Quality:** Medium  
   - **RTSP Authentication:** Disabled  
   - **RTSP Port:** 554

## 🌐 **Camera IP Address Configuration**  

### **Static IP (Recommended for Stability)**
Although Axiom has **DHCP**, and will provide a dynamic IP to the camera, using a **static IP** prevents delays with the image appearing and improves the reliabilty.

#### **Manual IP Settings:**
| Setting          | Value          |
|-----------------|---------------|
| DHCP           | **Disabled** |
| IP Address     | `198.18.2.91` |
| Subnet Mask    | `255.255.248.0` |
| Default Gateway | `198.18.2.46` |
| DNS Server     | `198.18.2.46` |

> *Thanks to forum member "**5TC**" on the [Sealine forum](https://sealineforum.forumotion.com) for discovering and documenting this*
>
> Note: Use of DHCP is possible, however this causes a slight delay when selecting the camera.
